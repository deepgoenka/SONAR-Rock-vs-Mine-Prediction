# SONAR Rock vs. Mine Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a given SONAR signal represents a Rock or a Mine using the RandomForest algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize a dataset containing SONAR signal data to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on the properties of the signal. The RandomForest algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex classification tasks.

## Accuracy

The model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between rocks and mines based on SONAR signals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains SONAR signal data obtained from various sources. It consists of features extracted from the signals along with the corresponding labels indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in classifying rocks and mines.

## Conclusion

The RandomForest algorithm demonstrates strong performance in predicting whether a given SONAR signal represents a rock or a mine. With an accuracy of 95%, the model shows promise in real-world applications for underwater object detection.
